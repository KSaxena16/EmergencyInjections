# Emergency Injections
## Adrenaline(Epinephrine) Injection:

Adrenaline is a drug that leads to increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, increased air entry, increased blood glucose, stimulates cardiac activity and reduce allergic reactions by reducing inflammatory response caused by histamine. Adrenaline action is fast yet it has a short duration. Due to these properties, it is used for the treatment of allergic and anaphylactic reactions (e.g. drug reactions, insect stings, food allergies).

### Common side effects: ###
1. breathing problems;
2. fast, irregular, or pounding heartbeats;
3. pale skin, sweating;
4. nausea and vomiting;
5. dizziness;
6. weakness or tremors;
7. headache; or
8. feeling restless, fearful, nervous, anxious, or excited.

## Norepinephrine(Noradrenaline) Injection:

Norepinephrine is used mainly as a sympathomimetic drug to treat people in vasodilatory shock states such as septic shock and neurogenic shock, while showing fewer adverse side-effects compared to dopamine treatment.

### Common side effects: ###
1. headache, slow heart rate, and anxiety
2. irregular heartbeat

## Atropine Injection: ##

Atropine is a tropane alkaloid and anticholinergic medication used to treat certain types of nerve agent and pesticide poisonings as well as some types of slow heart rate, and to decrease saliva production during surgery.It is typically given intravenously or by injection into a muscle.Eye drops are also available which are used to treat uveitis and early amblyopia.

### Common side effects: ###

1. dry mouth, large pupils, urinary retention, constipation, and a fast heart rate

## Amiodarone Injection: ##

Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic medication used to treat and prevent a number of types of cardiac dysrhythmias.This includes ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF), and wide complex tachycardia, as well as atrial fibrillation and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.
Amiodarone has been used both in the treatment of acute life-threatening arrhythmias as well as the long term suppression of arrhythmias. It is used both in supraventricular arrhythmias and ventricular arrhythmias.

### Common side effects: ###

1. feeling tired, tremor, nausea, and constipation
2. lung toxicity such as interstitial pneumonitis, liver problems, heart arrhythmias, vision problems, thyroid problems, and death
